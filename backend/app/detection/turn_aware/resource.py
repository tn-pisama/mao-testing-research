F3: Resource Misallocation Detector
===================================

Analyzes whether agents have appropriate resources:
1. Missing tools/capabilities - agent needs something they don't have
2. Wrong agent for task - task assigned to agent without required skills
3. Resource overload - one agent given too much work
4. Underutilized agents - some agents doing nothing while others overloaded
5. Tool/API failures - resources not working as expected
