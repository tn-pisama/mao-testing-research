F9: Role Usurpation Detector
============================

Analyzes whether agents act outside their designated roles:
1. Role boundary violation - agent performs tasks outside role scope
2. Role ambiguity - unclear or conflicting role assignments
3. Unauthorized actions - agent exceeds permission boundaries
4. Role drift - gradual deviation from assigned responsibilities

    3. Unauthorized actions - agent exceeds permission boundaries
    4. Role drift - gradual deviation from assigned responsibilities

    NOTE: F9 detection with rule-based/semantic approaches has limitations:
    - MAST F9 patterns are subtle and vary across frameworks
    - Semantic similarity between related roles causes false positives
    - AG2 trajectory parsing needs improvement for 21/40 F9 examples

    RECOMMENDATION: Use hybrid mode with LLM escalation for F9 detection
    to achieve reasonable accuracy. The turn-aware detector provides
    structural analysis but relies on LLM for nuanced judgment.
