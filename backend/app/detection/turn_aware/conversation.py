F4: Loss of Conversation History Detector
=========================================

Per MAST (FM-1.4): Unexpected context truncation, disregarding recent
interaction history and reverting to an antecedent conversational state.

Detects:
1. Repeated questions - asking questions already answered earlier
2. Lost decisions - contradicting or ignoring previous agreements
3. Context reset - treating conversation as if starting fresh
4. Forgotten constraints - ignoring previously stated requirements
